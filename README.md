Predicting whether a patient has heart diseas, using machine learning

This notebook uses various data science librabries in attempt to build a machine learning model capable of detecting whether a patient has heart disease, based on their medical attributes.

We've taken the following appraoch:

1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Conclusion

## 2. Data

This Cleveland database is used by machine learning researchers and originally published by UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease
    
A similar version of this database can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) however, there are some important differences between the UCI and Kaggle versions of the data. This is addressed in the Features section.
